  h1 Rock Climbing Instructor
  p.award-description.
    To be a full rock climbing instructor, will need to transfer your knowledge to real rock face conditions.
    The theory test will include everything in the rock climbing section of "Reach Beyond" and additional
    knowledge acquired from further reading - source of much of the instructor's knowledge.
    An instructor is permitted to sign off learners for their final tests â€” although the MIC or a
    leader must verify these sign-offs.
